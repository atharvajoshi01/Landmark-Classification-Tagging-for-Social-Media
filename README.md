# Landmark Recognition
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pipeline to process real-world images and create an app for predicting the location depicted in the image. The app leverages landmark recognition techniques to suggest the most likely locations where the image was taken.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to develop a robust data processing pipeline using CNN models. By tackling the challenge of identifying landmarks in images, the project aims to provide an engaging user experience by suggesting relevant location information for uploaded photos.

## Why Landmark Recognition?
Photo sharing and storage services greatly benefit from having location data associated with each uploaded photo. This enables the development of advanced features, including automatic tag suggestions and photo organization based on location. However, a significant portion of uploaded photos lacks location metadata due to various reasons, such as the absence of GPS data or privacy concerns leading to metadata removal.

In the absence of location metadata, one approach to infer the location is through the detection and classification of distinctive landmarks in the image. Given the vast number of landmarks worldwide and the sheer volume of images uploaded to photo services, manual classification becomes infeasible.

This project addresses this challenge by developing a CNN-powered app capable of predicting the location based on the recognized landmarks present in the image. The app's objective is to accept user-supplied images as input and suggest the top-k most relevant landmarks from a selection of 50 possible landmarks worldwide.
